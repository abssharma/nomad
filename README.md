**NOMAD**
Not One More Abandoned & Displaced

A Promise to Listen. To Locate. To Care.
Because every person deserves to be found, to be heard, and to have a chance.

**Overview**
NOMAD is a powerful humanitarian platform designed to support efforts in identifying, understanding, and assisting homeless individuals through modern technology. By combining AI-driven audio transcription, NLP-based data extraction, and geospatial heatmap visualization, NOMAD serves as a crucial tool for those on the frontlines of social impact—police departments, NGOs, public health officials, and concerned citizens.

This isn’t just a web app.
It’s a step toward dignity, awareness, and action.

**Key Features**
Voice-Based Profiling: Record or upload an individual’s voice and automatically extract key information such as name, conditions, concerns, and potential family links.

AI-Powered Extraction: Uses advanced NLP to distill meaningful, structured insights from unstructured speech.

Heatmap Visualization: Global homelessness distribution mapped out using real data to aid outreach and intervention strategies.

Secure & Ethical Storage: Profiles are stored responsibly, ensuring privacy while enabling authorities to act on urgent needs.

Search & Insights: Query profiles by name, location, or concerns to prioritize aid and track ongoing situations.
